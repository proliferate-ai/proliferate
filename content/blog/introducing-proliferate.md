We got into YC. Still a bit surreal to type that out.

## So, what are we actually building?

Proliferate is basically an AI that joins your engineering team—but instead of just reading your code, it watches what's actually happening in production. It digs through logs, errors, your docs, even old Slack threads, and pieces together what's going wrong. Then it tries to fix it and opens a PR.

The idea came from years of debugging production issues at 2am and thinking "why am I the one connecting all these dots?" There's so much context scattered everywhere—metrics, support tickets, that one doc someone wrote six months ago—and it felt like something should be able to do this legwork for us.

What makes it different from other AI coding tools:

- **It sees the full picture.** Not just your codebase, but logs, errors, traces—the stuff that tells you what's *actually* happening.
- **It picks up on how your team works.** The conventions, the patterns, the stuff that's never written down but everyone just knows.
- **It doesn't stop at "here's the problem."** It reproduces issues, tests fixes, and ships PRs when it's confident.

## Why YC?

Honestly? I've followed YC companies for years. So many tools I use every day came out of there. Being part of that community, getting to build alongside people who genuinely obsess over making things better—it's the kind of environment I've always wanted to be in.

We're just getting started. There's a lot more to share soon.
