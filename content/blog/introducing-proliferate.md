Our goal is to reimagine how software gets maintained. With YC, we have the right partners to make this a reality.

## What is Proliferate?

Proliferate is an AI engineer that understands your product. It connects to your production stack and institutional knowledge, reproduces issues, proposes fixes, and ships PRs.

What makes it different:

- **Production-aware.** Ingests logs, traces, metrics, and runtime incidents to reason about the real state of your system.
- **Institution-aware.** Indexes Slack, docs, tickets, and team conventions—the tribal knowledge that actually governs behavior.
- **Loop-closed.** Moves from signal → context → reproduction → validated fix → PR.

## Why YC?

I've always seen YC as the best startup accelerator out there. Companies like Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox, Vercel, and Supabase all came out of it.

Being a part of this program with such a fantastic group of founders and partners is really special.

This is just the beginning of a new journey and I'm looking forward to sharing every step of the way with you all!
