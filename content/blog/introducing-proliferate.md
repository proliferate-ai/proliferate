We're excited to announce that Proliferate is now backed by Y Combinator.

Our goal is to free engineers from the drudgery of digging through logs, debugging production issues, and connecting scattered context—so they can focus on building great products. With YC, we have the right partners to make this a reality.

## What is Proliferate?

Proliferate is an AI teammate for your engineering team. Think Sentry, but built from the ground up for a world where AI can actually understand your codebase, trace through logs, and tell you exactly what broke and how to fix it.

It watches what's happening in production, digs through your logs, errors, docs, and chat history, figures out what's going wrong, and sends you fixes as pull requests.

What makes it different:

- **Sees the full picture.** Not just your codebase, but logs, errors, traces—the signals that tell you what's actually happening in production.
- **Understands how your team works.** Picks up on conventions, patterns, and context from docs, support tickets, and team communication.
- **Ships fixes, not just alerts.** Reproduces issues, tests solutions, and opens PRs when it's confident.

## Why YC?

YC has been the launchpad for many of the tools we use every day—Stripe, Dropbox, GitLab, Supabase. Being part of this community with a fantastic group of founders and partners is the right environment for what we're building.

This is just the beginning. Looking forward to sharing more soon.
