# vNext Specs

These specs describe the **target (vNext) architecture** and may not match `main` yet.

- Current (implemented) specs live in `docs/specs/*.md`.
- vNext specs live in `docs/specs/vnext/*.md`.

Cutover plan:
- Keep vNext specs here while implementation lands.
- In the cutover PR (when code matches), move current specs to `*_archived.md` and promote vNext specs to the canonical filenames.
