# Coding Sessions

Coding sessions are where the real work happens. You have a fully configured cloud environment and an AI agent ready to help you build.

## Starting a session

Pick a snapshot to start from, and you'll have a ready-to-go environment in seconds. All your dependencies are installed, services are running, and you can start coding immediately.

## What you can do

### Write code together
Describe what you want to build, and the agent writes the code. You can be as high-level ("add user authentication") or specific ("add a logout button to the header") as you like.

### Debug issues
Paste an error message or describe unexpected behavior. The agent investigates, finds the problem, and fixes it.

### Explore the codebase
Ask questions about how things work. The agent reads your code and explains it.

### Run commands
Tests, builds, migrations - the agent can run any command and handle the results.

## The preview panel

When you're building something with a UI, the preview panel shows your changes live. Click the preview icon in the header to toggle it.

## Pausing and resuming

Sessions automatically pause when you're away to save resources. When you come back, just click Resume - your environment is restored exactly as you left it.

## Tips

- **Be direct** - "Fix the login bug" works better than "I think there might be an issue with logging in maybe"
- **Give context** - "The signup form should validate email format" is clearer than "add validation"
- **Iterate** - start simple, see the result, then refine
