# Getting Started

Welcome! Here's how to go from zero to coding in the cloud.

## The basic flow

1. **Connect your repo** - Link a GitHub repository you want to work on
2. **Set up your environment** - Run a setup session to install dependencies and configure services
3. **Save a snapshot** - Capture your configured environment so you can reuse it
4. **Start coding** - Launch coding sessions from your snapshot and build with AI

## Your first time

### 1. Add a repository

Click **Add Repo** and connect your GitHub account. Pick a repository - we'll clone it to your cloud environment.

### 2. Run setup

Click **Set Up** on your repo. An AI agent helps you install dependencies, configure databases, and get everything running. This usually takes a few minutes.

### 3. Save a snapshot

When setup is complete, save a snapshot. Give it a name like "Initial setup" - you'll use this to start coding sessions.

### 4. Start coding

Click **New Session**, pick your snapshot, and start building. The AI agent can write code, debug issues, run tests, and more.
